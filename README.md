# ETL_Project

Project Proposal 
We are looking to extract, load, and transform crime and parking ticket data for major cities in the US.
To do this, we will examine parking ticket data for these cities from https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/parking-violations-issued-in-december-2018/data (each month has its own link) and crime data from https://datagate.dc.gov/search/open/crimes?daterange=1-1-2018,12-31-2018&details=true&format=csv.
We will investigate the relationship between parking ticket citations and crime by date and location.
Anticipated challenges include finding the appropriate joins to merge multiple into workable queries for the purposes of this project.
